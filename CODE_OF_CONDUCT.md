# Igl (Igel) Code of Conduct

Igl (Igel) is an open-source project and we welcome contributions from everyone. We want to create a welcoming and inclusive community around Igl. To achieve this, we have adopted a code of conduct that we expect all contributors to follow. This code of conduct outlines our expectations for behavior within the Igl community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

## Our expectations

We expect all contributors to:

- Be respectful and considerate of others.
- Be kind and empathetic.
- Be open to feedback and willing to learn from others.
- Be patient and understanding.
- Be inclusive and welcoming to all.

## Unacceptable behavior

Unacceptable behavior includes, but is not limited to:

- Harassment, discrimination, or bullying of any kind.
- Offensive, disrespectful, or inappropriate language or behavior.
- Disruptive or disrespectful comments or actions.
- Intimidation or threats.
- Any other behavior that is harmful or unwelcoming.

## Consequences

If a contributor engages in unacceptable behavior, the Igl maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary or permanent ban from the project. The Igl maintainers will also take any other action they deem necessary to ensure a safe and welcoming community for all contributors.

## Reporting

If you witness or experience unacceptable behavior, please report it to the Igl maintainers at [me@binaryblazer.me](mailto:binaryblazer.me) or by opening an issue on GitHub. All reports will be kept confidential and will be taken seriously.

## Conclusion
